                        Culpability for Reddit falls on the shoulders of two people: Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham. The internet’s notorious hive of scum and villainy could have been an app for ordering food, instead, but the aforementioned founders of tech startup incubator Y Combinator turned-down would-be My Mobile Menu founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian for a spot in their inaugural class. Had Paul Graham had a bit more vision, or Jessica Livingston a bit less compassion, we might have been spared the likes of /pol. Graham rejected My Mobile Menu, then Livingston convinced him to accept Huffman and Ohanian if they'd come-up with a different project.

                        What they came-up was a knock-off of an existing site called Digg. A Digg clone that would eventually overtake and completely eclipse its inspiration. But Paul Graham wasn't done. The late internet freedom activist Aaron Swartz's own start-up, Infogami, was failing to thrive. Graham arranged for Reddit to merge with Infogami, and for Swartz to join the team (<a href="">Fiegerman</a>). Swartz played a central role in translating Reddit's code from the powerful but obscure Lisp language into Python (<a href="">Spez</a>; <a href="">Swartz</a>). Lisp's macro system allows programmers to write code that writes more code, in a way that only languages with Lisp-like syntax can (<a href="">Graham</a>). Unfortunately, the unusual syntax that allows these profoundly expressive macros repels most programmers. It would have been very difficult for Reddit to hire developers, and therefore, to find investors or a buyer. However, with Swartz's rewrite aided by his web.py library, Reddit was free to grow. Less than a year later, Conde Nast, publisher of then-still-influential WiReD magazine, bought Reddit, moved it to San Francisco, bought it servers, and hired more staff.

                        With a toxic mixture of anonymity and a longtime policy of upholding hate speech as free speech, Reddit is rife with controversy. One of the original Reddit creators, Alex Ohanian, wanted to work on projects that "make the world suck less," but by 2012 (four years after his departure), Reddit was on front page news for some truly soul-sucking subreddits that Reddit administrators refused to ban (<a href="">Lagorio-Chafkin</a>; <a href="">BBC</a>; <a href="">Wikipedia</a>). Over the years, Reddit has updated some of its policies and banned or quarantined (i.e. made hard to find) subreddits that gain bad publicity, but if you look, you can still find toxic and controversial communities that are given a voice on Reddit.

                        In 2012, these toxic subreddits came to the nation's attention when one of their moderators was doxxed in a Gawker article (<a href="">Chen</a>). Reddit CEO at the time, Yishan Wong, refused to ban subreddits containing hateful, yet technically legal, content. One subreddit, r/jailbait, garnered widespread attention in 2011. This subreddit was devoted to suggestive pictures of children, and was banned after CNN ran an exposé on the subreddit. Following that ban, the subreddit’s creator (and moderator of many other problematic subreddits), @violentacrez, was outed on Gawker by reporter Adrian Chen as Michael Brutsch, a middle-aged man in Texas. From Chen's reporting, it became clear that Brutsch had explicit support of Reddit staff as he trolled and incited hate speech on Reddit. The premise for this support was the same argument for "hate speech as free speech" that continues to crop up today, every time something like the Charlie Hebdo attack happens in the world, or when public institutions host speakers or events that promote controversial views (<a href="">Bleich</a>; <a href="">Raphelson</a>; <a href="">Sumpter</a>).

                        While Reddit has become somewhat infamous for its controversies, it is also the home of goodwill and positive interaction among its members. In the subreddit, r/Ask Reddit, a user asked “Could I destroy the entire Roman Empire during the reign of Augustus if I traveled back in time with a modern US Marine infantry battalion or MEU?” James Irwin replied with a imaginative narrative-like comment. The thread became popular and he was contacted by a film producer. He left his financial services firm to become a Hollywood screenwriter.

                        In 2009, Reddit gift started as a way to bring communities together in real life via Secret Santa gift exchange, with like Bill Gates and snoop participating. The success of this led to other exchanges. Communities on reddit frequently organize and direct charitable endeavors. Well known ones include humanitarian relief following earthquakes in Haiti in 2010 and Nepal in 2015. In 2010, the r/atheism subreddit decided to raise funding for Doctors Without Borders and promoted friendly competition with Christianity subreddit who began money for Word Vision. Later, the Islamic subreddit joined in and raised money for the Islamic Relief charity. The three communities raised over $50,000 in less than a week.

                        In 2017, University of Utah researchers did a study on r/depression. The researchers analyzed the language used by subscribers on the subreddit over time and concluded that users language improved in nine of ten categories, suggesting the subreddit prompted a “positive emotion change” in users. The study extended to the two other major mental health subreddits, r/bipolar, and r/schizophrenia. They used r/happy, r/bodybuilding, and r/loseit as their control group, and the researchers determined that contributors to the mental health subreddits appeared to have trouble clearly communicating initially. Over time, those users showed “statistically significant improvement” in both their lexical diversity and readability. The lead author of the study, Albert Park noted "I can't speak for my coauthors, but I want to stress the value of emotional and information support that are provided by your peers through social media platforms like Reddit," he told Gizmodo.
