                        <a href="">Yes, absolutely</a>, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.

                        When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Computer, belay that order. <a href="www.latimes.com">How long can two people talk</a> about nothing? Besides, you look good in a dress. Your shields were failing, sir. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here.
                    </p>

                        Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. They were just sucked into space. Computer, lights up! Travel time to the nearest starbase? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Damage report! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I am your worst nightmare!

                       Your head is not an artifact! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." and attack the Romulans. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Not if I weaken first. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.
