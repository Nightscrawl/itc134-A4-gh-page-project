Reddit Controversy

With a toxic mixture of anonymity and a longtime policy of upholding hate speech as free speech, Reddit is rife with controversy. One of the original Reddit creators, Alex Ohanian, wanted to work on projects that “make the world suck less,”[1] but by 2012 (four years after Ohanian left Reddit), Reddit was on front page news for some truly soul-sucking subreddits that Reddit administrators refused to ban.[2,3] Over the years, Reddit has updated some of its policies and banned or quarantined (i.e. made hard to find) subreddits that gain bad publicity. But if you look, you can still find really toxic and controversial communities that are given a voice on Reddit.

In 2012 the topic of toxic subreddits came to the nation's attention when a moderator on various toxic subreddits was doxxed in a Gawker article.[5] Reddit CEO at the time, Yishan Wong, refused to ban subreddits containing toxic, yet legal, content. One subreddit, r/jailbait, garnered widespread attention in 2011. This subreddit was devoted to suggestive pictures of children, and was banned after CNN ran an exposé on the subreddit. Following that ban, the subreddit creator (and moderator of many other problematic subreddits) @violentacrez was outed on Gawker by reporter Adrian Chen as Michael Brutsch, a middle-aged man in Texas. From Chen's reporting, it became clear that Brutsch had explicit support of Reddit staff as he trolled and incited hate speech on Reddit. The premise for this support was the same argument for "hate speech as free speech" that continues to crop up today, every time something like the Charlie Hebdo attack happens in the world, or every time Donald Trump speaks or tweets.
