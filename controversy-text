Reddit Controversy

With a toxic mixture of anonymity and a longtime policy of upholding hate speech as free speech, Reddit is rife with controversy. One of the original Reddit creators, Alex Ohanian, wanted to work on projects that “make the world suck less,”[1] but by 2012 (four years after Ohanian left Reddit), Reddit was on front page news for some truly soul-sucking subreddits that Reddit administrators refused to ban.[2,3] Over the years, Reddit has updated some of its policies and banned or quarantined (i.e. made hard to find) subreddits that gain bad publicity. But if you look, you can still find really toxic and controversial communities that are given a voice on Reddit.[5]
